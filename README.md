# Binary-Search-Tree-Implementation
*In binary search tree each node can hae at most 2 children__
*Basic functions in Binary search Tree__
 -"struct BstNode": Definition of Node for Binary search tree
 -"GetNewNode": Function to create a new Node in heap
 -"Insert": Function to insert data in BST, returns address of root node
 -"Search": Function to  search an element in BST, returns true if element is found
 -"FindMin": Function to find the minimum element in the binary search tree
 -"FindMax": Function to find the maximum element in the binary search tree
 -"FindHeight": Function to find height of a binary tree
 -"Delete": Function to search a value and delete it 
 
*Tree Traversal: process of visiting each node in the tree exactely once in some order
 1-Breadth-first
  -"LevelOrder": Function to print Nodes in a binary tree in Level order
 2-Depth-first
  -"PreOrder": Function to visit root then visit left sub-tree then visit right sub-tree
  -"InOrder": Function to visit left sub-tree then visit root then visit right sub-tree
  -"PostOrder": Function to visit left sub-tree then visit right sub-tree then visit root
