# Binary-Search-Tree-Implementation
*In binary search tree each node can have at most 2 children <br />
*Basic functions in Binary search Tree <br />
 -"struct BstNode": Definition of Node for Binary search tree <br />
 -"GetNewNode": Function to create a new Node in heap <br />
 -"Insert": Function to insert data in BST, returns address of root node <br />
 -"Search": Function to  search an element in BST, returns true if element is found <br />
 -"FindMin": Function to find the minimum element in the binary search tree <br />
 -"FindMax": Function to find the maximum element in the binary search tree <br />
 -"FindHeight": Function to find height of a binary tree <br />
 -"Delete": Function to search a value and delete it <br />
 <br />
*Tree Traversal: process of visiting each node in the tree exactely once in some order <br />
 1-Breadth-first <br />
  -"LevelOrder": Function to print Nodes in a binary tree in Level order <br />
 2-Depth-first <br />
  -"PreOrder": Function to visit root then visit left sub-tree then visit right sub-tree <br />
  -"InOrder": Function to visit left sub-tree then visit root then visit right sub-tree <br />
  -"PostOrder": Function to visit left sub-tree then visit right sub-tree then visit root <br />
